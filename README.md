# Combined stress

This repository contains a model that predicts [describe what your model predicts].

## Getting Started

To use this model, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy keras scikit-learn
```

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_repo>/your-model.git
cd your-model
```
or To download the code directly from the repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Look for the green "Code" button on the right side of the page.
2. Click on the "Code" button.
3. In the dropdown that appears, select "Download ZIP".
4. Save the ZIP file to your computer and extract the contents.

This will download the entire repository as a ZIP file, which you can then extract to access the code.
### Examples
Your data looks like this 
| TREATMENT |Tempratute | Drought | Plant |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Control   | 28.00     | None    | Rice  |
| Drought   | 28.00     | Mild    | None  |
| D+H       | 36.00     | Mild    | None  |
| Heat      | 36.00     | None    | None  |


Convert this table to the format given in Example.csv



### Usage

1. Upload your data in the same format as `example.csv`.
2. Run the model using `model.py`.

```bash
python model.py
```

### Model Creation

The Python code for complete model creation can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file `Combined_stress.ipynb`. The required data for training is available in `X_train.csv` and `y_train.csv`.

### Files
